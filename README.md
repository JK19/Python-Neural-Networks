# Python Neural Network module
## Experimental module without dependencies, using only python standard libraries
* Written in Python 3.x
* User configurable network architecture
* User configurable network training parameters
* No external libraries (like numpy)

I have written this module to study the algorithms of a multilayer perceptron.
The goal is to keep the code as simple as possible to clearly see network algorithms without focusing too much on performance.

## To do:
* Normalize the input of the network
* Make a loader to feed the network from .csv/.xml/... files
* Stop training by timeout or error stabilization
* Make a Jupyter notebook with the training of a network with real world public datasets

## How to run the demo:
`python RNA.py`
